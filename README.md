# LEGO® Design

This project is about computational LEGO® design and was created in 2024 summer (May 2024 - August 2024). I did this project during the UG Summer Research Internship at CUHK supervised by Prof. Chi-Wing FU, Philip. The method follows this article: Computational Design of LEGO® Sketch Art, and you can find this article here https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3618306. It also includes two reports and a poster, which show my research progress and some preliminary results.
