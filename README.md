# Computational LEGO® Design

This project is about computational LEGO® design and was created in 2024 summer (May 2024 - August 2024). I did this project during the UG Summer Research Internship at CUHK supervised by Prof. Chi-Wing FU, Philip. The method follows this article: Computational Design of LEGO® Sketch Art, and you can find this article here https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3618306. It also includes two reports and a [Poster](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18467685/Poster.pdf), which show my research progress and some preliminary results.

## Source codes
### design.py
You can upload a simple image with one closed curve and then run it to get a .ldr file, which can be viewed in LDView.
### graph.py
This program implements graph optimization.
### bricks.py
This program includes connectivity optimization and stability analysis.
